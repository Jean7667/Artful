            <h1>About the collection - gallery of digital art</h1>
            <p>the collection – gallery of digital art is a platform with the aim to revolutionize the concept of an
                art gallery.
                The focus lies not only on establishing an appreciation for digital art and furthermore
                for its collection value, which is guaranteed by a limitation of the editions as well as
                by the certificate of authenticity, but also on supporting emerging artists,
                especially those who have been underrepresented at the art market so far
            </p>
            <p>
                The gallery´s mission also includes making
                digital art accessible and creating a new experience of collecting art, especially for
                younger generations – so that, besides feeling joy for owning a contemporary artwork,
                they also feel great knowing that their purchase has supported a specific young
                talent.

            </p>
            <p>
                the collection – gallery of digital art functions as a hybrid gallery-model which does not only show
                the artworks online but
                also at exhibitions in various spaces and at art fairs. Presenting the works at
                exhibitions as well as at art fairs allows on the one hand a face-to-face contact
                between the team of the gallery and recipients or potential buyers and on the other hand
                an opportunity to working closely together with the artist. Because the main space of
                the gallery remains the online format, the possibility of staying flexible and trying
                out new ways of exhibiting art are provided. Furthermore, creating curated exhibitions
                includes writing about the artworks and therefore linking them to art theory and art
                history.

            collection – gallery of digital art is managed by Felicitas Pilz, who has been committed to
            promoting as well as supporting young talents in art photography since 2018 with her self-initiated
            project BlitzBündel - da schau hin and has over the years realized several solo and group exhibitions
            with a total of 87 aspiring art photographers as part of these activities. Due to her focus on equal
            opportunities and diversity, she was nominated for the Graz Women's Award 2020 in relation to this
            project. The art history graduate and former student of the College of Fine Art Photography and
            MultimediaArt at the Ortweinschule also gained practical experience in regard to exhibition organization
            for video and media art during her employment as a project assistant at esc medien kunst labor as well
            as at the Centre of Contemporary Art at the University of Graz
