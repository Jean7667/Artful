                            of digital art </span>is a platform with the aim to revolutionize the concept of an
                        art gallery.
                        The focus lies not only on establishing an appreciation for digital art and furthermore
                        for its collection value, which is guaranteed by a limitation of the editions as well as
                        by the certificate of authenticity, but also on supporting emerging artists,
                        especially those who have been underrepresented at the art market so far.
                    </span>
                </p>

                <p class=""><span class="">The
                        gallery´s mission also includes making
                        digital art accessible and creating a new experience of collecting art, especially for
                        younger generations – so that, besides feeling joy for owning a contemporary artwork,
                        they also feel great knowing that their purchase has supported a specific young
                        talent.</span></p>

                <p class=""><span class=""><span
                           class="">the collection – gallery of digital art</span>
                        functions as a hybrid gallery-model which does not only show the artworks online but
                        also at exhibitions in various spaces and at art fairs. Presenting the works at
                        exhibitions as well as at art fairs allows on the one hand a face-to-face contact
                        between the team of the gallery and recipients or potential buyers and on the other hand
                        an opportunity to working closely together with the artist. Because the main space of
                        the gallery remains the online format, the possibility of staying flexible and trying
                        out new ways of exhibiting art are provided. Furthermore, creating curated exhibitions
                        includes writing about the artworks and therefore linking them to art theory and art
                        history.</span></p>
