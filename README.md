DAY 1(Virtual)

At the start of the day we discussed the different methods to collaborate and created a huddle on slack so we can communicate throughout the day  . We decided on using a trello board over a github board . For wireframes we decided to use balsamiq . We then had to decide on which project and chose the art gallery . Next we brainstormed project names. Using A.I we got suggestions, some of these included “Elevate Art” , “Artisan Avenue” “Refined Visions” however after much debate we chose Jeans idea ‘Artful’. We then discussed whether to use the branching or forking method and chose branching  as Jean and Vedran are familiar with the branching method . For a design we all googled different websites for inspiration `and after much deliberation we finally agreed on one but in a more simplistic version . We chose to implement six pages to the website , Home, About Us, Artists , Gallery, News and Contact Page. We then decided not to use the contact page and instead chose to put contact details in the footer of each page. Vedran as team leader then assigned each of us a page.Vedran chose the home page,Tim was assigned the gallery page, Jean was assigned the News page  and Archana chose the About us and volunteered to do the artists page. Vedran started the wireframe while Jean showed Archana and Tim how to use the branching method . Tim then chose sixteen images for the gallery page and everyone agreed they would be suitable . Vedran shared the wireframe to the slack channel and created a repository on github . Each member made their own branch for the project on github.Jean used microsoft bing to design a picture based around the website name , he shared two possible designs on the slack channel. Vedran wanted to use one but the rest of the team preferred the other so we chose that . We then did a rough copy of the user stories. We also chose to have a cart section and prices for each of the artworks. 

Day 2(on-site )
Vedran as team leader felt ill ao unfortunately couldn't show up so Tim was promoted to team leader . We then as a team decided how to proceed and who was taking responsibility for each page .  Us three on-site chose to remove the artists page as we felt we might be limited on time.  Jean took responsibility for the main content on the home page as well as the news page  , Archana chose the about us page as well as doing the menu for each header.  Vedran had started the footer on the home page however Archana finished the footer as we felt that it was lacking the content we needed . Tim took the gallery page , the read.me file and to type up the user stories we'd discussed  .  After everyone knew their roles we started on the webpage . Initially we had problems uploading to github using the branching method but after some research Jean figured out what the issue was .  The team decided to use bootstrap for page layouts as it had the layouts we needed  . Tim initially had issues while trying to implement bootstrap as the bottom two pictures in the gallery were stretching, however with help from Martin in the Code Institute team the issue was resolved . Archana completed the about page without any issue however the logo we'd chosen for the header had an issue with the spacing around it so we chose a new logo . Jean had completed  the  news page . We decided as the team to remove the cart button and pricing section as we felt the content we had left would suffice.

Day 3 (on-site)
Unfortunately Vedran was still feeling ill so couldn't attend . Jean made the final adjustments to the gallery page as Tim completed the read.me . Archana and Jean tested the website ,fixed issues/bugs  and made adjustments to the menus on each page . We had some time left so Archana re-added the artist page .
